AbobeArt is a repository that will contain projects I've made in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. Being a young developer I love taking on new challenges and growing my skill so I decided to learn to use Adobe Products to make projects that could, and most likely will, increase my creativity with virtual enviorments that I have been making in Unity3D and Blender for the past year. I am very excited to share my 2D, and some 3D, art made with these programs!

<br /> You can download these images if you would like. You will need to have their respective program (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign) downloaded.
<br />
<br /> Click on the projects file in the respository and then click "View Raw" and it will download and open right to the program.
<br />
<br /> You also can go to the green button "Clone or download" and then clock "Download Zip". A zip file with each of these projects will download onto your desktop so you can explore them all!

<br /> The first project in this repository is called 3Ddonuts. It is a 2D yet 3D image made in Adobe Illustrator. The was created using custom made symbols (the black rectangles) copied numerous times to surround a circle, also custom, to create its sphere shape. The 3D Revolve tool was then used to rotate and place the circle object in a formation to give off a 3D look as a donut and Map Art implemented the custom black rectangles to the donut shape to elimiate its circular appearence. The look of 3Ddonuts was completed by ungrouping and deleting the back rectangles, adding a color to the background and donuts stripes to combine/differentiate them, and utilizing the gradient tool for the overall 3D effect. The artist can either choose to make the donut one solid color using gradient coloring or by selecting the donut and pressing a combination of COMMAND+8 as the graident will then cover the entire donut making; one half darker than the other. Many shapes can be used to create this piece and any colors to the artists liking as well!
