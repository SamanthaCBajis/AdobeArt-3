# AdobeArt-_-
AbobeArt is a repository that will contain projects I've made in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. Being a young developer I love taking on new challenges an continuing to grow my skillset. So, I decided to learn more Adobe Products to make projects that could, and most likely will, increase my creativity and design ability with virtual enviorments which I have been constructing in Unity3D, with the help of C# and Blender, for the past year. I am very excited to share my art made with these programs below!
<br />
<br /> You can download any of these images if you would like. You will need to have their respective program (Illustrator or InDesign) already downloaded to do so.
<br />
<br /> Click on the projects file name in the respository and then click "View Raw" and it will download and open right in Illustrator or InDesign.
<br />
<br /> Also you can go to the green button on the right titled "Clone or download" and then click "Download Zip". A zip file with all of these projects will download onto your desktop so you can explore them all!
## 3Ddonuts
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-25 at 9 53 19 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44618902-c0c64400-a84c-11e8-9cc8-6345aa4795fd.png)
<br /> The first project in this repository is called 3Ddonuts. It is a 2D image, with a 3D look, made in Adobe Illustrator. The was created using custom made symbols (black rectangles) copied numerous times to surround a circle object, also custom made, to create its sphere shape. 
<br /> The 3D Revolve tool was then used to rotate and place the circle object in a formation to give off a 3D look, more or less, as a donut. Map Art was utilized to implement the custom black rectangles onto the donut shape.
<br /> The look of 3Ddonuts was completed by ungrouping and deleting the back rectangles, adding a color to the background and donuts rectangles to combine them, and the gradient tool used on the rectangles for the overall 3D effect.
<br /> The artist can either choose to make the donut one solid color using a gradient swatch or by selecting the donut and pressing a combination of COMMAND+8 so the graident swatch will cover the entire donut; making one half darker than the other. Many shapes can be used to create this piece and any colors to the artists liking as well!

## NightWolf
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-26 at 8 16 11 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634865-0c700f00-a96d-11e8-9e5c-bcb6c44a021f.png)
<br /> NightWolf is a picture, literally art created just to learn more as well as continue practice using Adobe Illustrator. Guided by Vector Slate | Graphic Design Tutorials on YouTube I was able to create this piece using all kinds of different effects and tools.
<br /> The background is a gradient swatch custom created to the color choices I liked for the night sky. The clouds were made using the brush tool and the opacity is lessened on each cloud clump to give them the look of overlapping and being scattered in the sky around the wolf. 
<br /> The stars, and the shooting star, were made with a combination of the paint and gradient swatchs. The light sources behind the wolf, which itself is a generic vector found on Google Images, are a combination of purple and pink Radient Gradient swatches created combined using the elipse tool.

## Polly.TheFox.
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-26 at 8 18 17 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634884-49d49c80-a96d-11e8-801d-c11e09832ffb.png)
<br /> Polly.TheFox. is pretty much how it sounds, a portrait of a low poly fox. Image taken from a photo found on Google Images of a live fox shown below:
<br /> ![fox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634892-55c05e80-a96d-11e8-9302-2099856f4b33.jpg)
<br /> This picture is made of several uses of the pen tool and eyedropper tool. Each colored section of the fox is a triangle made with the pen tool to encompass that area and then the eyedropper tool is used to fill the triangle with the dominant color within that traingle.
<br /> This process was continued until half of the fox portrait was completed. Then, the triangles of the half were grouped and reflected to make the oppposite side of the fox's face completing the portrait.

## VRwithAdobe
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-26 at 8 24 00 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634978-2c540280-a96e-11e8-9305-1235adea22a4.png)
<br /> VRwithAdobe is the first project in this repository created in Adobe InDesign. It is a small ad/poster/really any way of promotion for virtual and augmented reality. Creating the project I learned a lot about Adobe InDesign though layout and different advertising ideas to make the promotional piece more interesting to a possible reader.
<br /> The photo of the girl with the VR headset was taken from Google Images and then cut out using the combination of the pen tool and clipping mask to eliminate the original white background surrounding the photo.
<br /> The headset photo was placed in the middle as the star of the add, virtual and augmented reality's names were placed to the left side and quotes to the right to draw the readers attention from left to right, thus reading, or quickly scanning, the entirety of the ad.
<br /> Similar colors are used from the photo to make the imagry and information blend. Quotes were incorporated from Google of some interesting expectations and excitement for virtual and augmented reality software.

## Corrosion Promotion
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-26 at 8 24 29 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634985-41c92c80-a96e-11e8-824a-bbd9134316b6.png)
<br /> This small eye catching ad, created in Adobe InDesign, was used for a small project on the innovations of testing salt sprays to lesson the possibiliy of corrosion on metals. The ad is meant to be sent in an email and draw the customer in to click on a link to an article that would be provided below this design.
<br /> The images of the corrosion chamber and metallic, cartoon nuts and bolts were found on Google Images and placed along side each other to create the look of positivity in corrosion testing advances.
<br /> Text was added with the message to the right of the photo, also color blended with the colors presented on the corrosion chamber, which is a short blurb that can give the reader an idea of what the email is pertaining to as well as the idea for the photo presented before them.
