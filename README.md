AbobeArt is a repository that will contain projects I've made in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. Being a young developer I love taking on new challenges an continuing to grow my skillset. So, I decided to learn more Adobe Products to make projects that could, and most likely will, increase my creativity and design ability with virtual enviorments which I have been constructing in Unity3D, with the help of C# and Blender, for the past year. I am very excited to share my art made with these programs below!
<br />
<br /> You can download any of these images if you would like. You will need to have their respective program (Illustrator or InDesign) already downloaded to do so.
<br />
<br /> Click on the projects file name in the respository and then click "View Raw" and it will download and open right in Illustrator or InDesign.
<br />
<br /> Also you can go to the green button on the right titled "Clone or download" and then click "Download Zip". A zip file with all of these projects will download onto your desktop so you can explore them all!
## 3Ddonuts
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-25 at 9 53 19 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44618902-c0c64400-a84c-11e8-9cc8-6345aa4795fd.png)
<br /> The first project in this repository is called 3Ddonuts. It is a 2D image, with a 3D look, made in Adobe Illustrator. The was created using custom made symbols (black rectangles) copied numerous times to surround a circle object, also custom made, to create its sphere shape. 
<br /> The 3D Revolve tool was then used to rotate and place the circle object in a formation to give off a 3D look, more or less, as a donut. Map Art was utilized to implement the custom black rectangles onto the donut shape.
<br /> The look of 3Ddonuts was completed by ungrouping and deleting the back rectangles, adding a color to the background and donuts rectangles to combine them, and the gradient tool used on the rectangles for the overall 3D effect.
<br /> The artist can either choose to make the donut one solid color using a gradient swatch or by selecting the donut and pressing a combination of COMMAND+8 so the graident swatch will cover the entire donut; making one half darker than the other. Many shapes can be used to create this piece and any colors to the artists liking as well!
