# AdobeArt-_-
AbobeArt is a repository that will contain my projects made in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. Being a young developer I love taking on new challenges an continuing to grow my skillset. So, I decided to learn more Adobe Creative Suite products to make projects that could, and most likely will, increase my creativity and design ability with virtual enviorments; which I have been constructing in Unity3D, with the help of C# and Blender, for the past year. I am very excited to share my art made with these programs below!
<br />
<br /> You can download any of the projects if you would like. You will need to have their respective program (Illustrator or InDesign) already downloaded to do so.
<br />
<br /> To download them separately click on the projects folder in the respository, click on the name of the project again and then "View Raw". It will download and open right in Illustrator or InDesign.
<br />
<br /> To download and open all together, which is recommended, go to the green button on the right titled "Clone or download" and then click "Download Zip". A zip file with all of these projects will download onto your desktop!
## 3Ddonuts
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-25 at 9 53 19 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44618902-c0c64400-a84c-11e8-9cc8-6345aa4795fd.png)
<br /> The first project in this repository is called 3Ddonuts. It is a 2D image, with a 3D look, made in Adobe Illustrator. The was created using custom made symbols (black rectangles or stripes) copied numerous times to surround a circle object, also custom made, to create its sphere shape. 
<br /> The 3D Revolve Tool was used to rotate and place the circle object in a formation to give a 3D vibe, more or less, as a donut picture from the side. Map Art was utilized to implement the custom black rectangles (strips) onto the donut shape.
<br /> The look of 3Ddonuts was completed by ungrouping and deleting the back stripes, adding a color to the background and donuts stripes to combine them, and the Gradient Tool used on the stripes for the overall 3D effect.
<br /> The artist can either choose to make the donut one solid color using a gradient swatch or by selecting the donut and pressing a combination of COMMAND+8 so the Graident swatch will cover the entire donut; making one half darker than the other. Many shapes can be used to create this piece and any colors to the artists liking as well!

## NightWolf
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-26 at 8 16 11 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634865-0c700f00-a96d-11e8-9e5c-bcb6c44a021f.png)
<br /> NightWolf is a picture, literally just a custom art piece created in hopes to learn more and practice using Adobe Illustrator. Guided by Vector Slate | Graphic Design Tutorials on YouTube I was able to create this using a blend of different effects and tools.
<br /> The background is a Gradient swatch custom created to the color choices I imagined for the night sky. The clouds were made using the Brush Tool and the Opacity is lessened on each cloud clump to look like they are overlapping and being scattered in the sky over the wolf. 
<br /> The stars, and the shooting star, were made with a combination of the Paint and Gradient swatchs. The light sources behind the wolf, which itself is a generic vector found on Google Images, are a combination of purple and pink Radial Gradient swatches created combined using the Ellipse Tool.

## Polly.TheFox.
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-26 at 8 18 17 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634884-49d49c80-a96d-11e8-801d-c11e09832ffb.png)
<br /> Polly.TheFox. is pretty much how it sounds, a portrait of a low poly fox. Image taken from a photo found on Google Images of a live fox shown below:
<br /> ![fox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44634892-55c05e80-a96d-11e8-9302-2099856f4b33.jpg)
<br /> This picture is made of repeated actiona of the Pen and Eyedropper Tool. Each colored section of the fox is a triangle made with the Pen Tool to encompass that specific area of the face then the Eyedropper Tool is used to fill the triangle with the dominant color within that traingle.
<br /> This process was continued until half of the fox portrait was completed then the triangles of the half were grouped and reflected to make the opposite side of the fox's face completing the portrait.

<br /> VRwithAdobe is the first project in this repository created in Adobe InDesign. It is a small ad/poster/really any way of promotion for virtual and augmented reality. Creating the project I learned a lot about Adobe InDesign though layout and different advertising ideas to make the promotional piece more interesting to a possible reader.
<br /> The photo of the girl with the VR headset was taken from Google Images and then cut out using the combination of the Pen Tool and Clipping Mask to eliminate the original white background surrounding the photo.
<br /> The headset photo was placed in the middle as the star of the add, virtual and augmented realitys names were placed to the left side and quotes to the right to draw the readers attention from left to right, thus reading or quickly scanning, the entirety of the ad.
<br /> Similar colors are used from the photo to make the imagry and information blend. Quotes were incorporated from Google of some interesting expectations and excitement for virtual and augmented reality software.

## Corrosion Promotion
<br /> ![screen shot 2018-08-27 at 8 54 13 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35173600/44672962-2276e180-a9f8-11e8-8f88-007816afa54b.png)
<br /> This small eye catching ad, created in Adobe InDesign, was used for a small project on the innovations of testing salt sprays to lesson the possibiliy of corrosion on metals. The ad is meant to be sent in an email and draw the customer in to click on a link to an article that would be provided below this design.
<br /> The images of the corrosion chamber and metallic, cartoon nuts and bolts were found on Google Images and placed along side each other to create the look of positivity in corrosion testing advances.
<br /> Text was added with the message to the right of the photo, also color blended with the colors presented on the corrosion chamber, which is a short blurb that can give the reader an idea of what the email is pertaining to as well as the idea for the photo presented before them.
